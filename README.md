# PyCity Schools with Pandas

## Overview
We have been notified by the school board that the <code>students_complete.csv</code> file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards. We have been asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with **NaNs** while keeping the rest of the data intact.

With the suspicious math and reading scores removed from the district calculations, presented here is the updated school district analysis report.

### Results:
Here, we will find the updated School District Summary displaying average math and reading scores, and percentage passing for the district as a whole:

Here are the test results per school and per grade level:

## Summary:

There is a statement summarizing four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt).
