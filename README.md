# PyCity Schools with Pandas

We have been notified by the school board that the <code>students_complete.csv</code> file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards. We have been asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with **NaNs** while keeping the rest of the data intact.

With the suspicious math and reading scores being removed from the calculations, we are presenting the updated school district analysis report.

The purpose of this analysis is well defined (3 pt).
Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt).
